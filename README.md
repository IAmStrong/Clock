# Clock

This is my student work, a canvas-based application that shows the current time and date in the following formats:
- <strong>hh:mm</strong>
- <strong>hh:mm:ss</strong> (left-click to show)
- <strong>mm:dd:yy</strong> (right-click to show)

The project has been developed during my attendance of the Web UI courses at SoftServe.
